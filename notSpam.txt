"Subject: neon retreat
ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !
i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .
on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .
i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .
the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .
the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .
email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )
have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !

please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .
let me know if you have any questions or comments ."

subject : gap certificates
hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ?
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap .
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will
probably say no .
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to .
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store .
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world .
we
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help .
thank you for your support !
sincerely ,
janelle mccan

"Subject: re : pg & e texas meeting
recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet ."

"Subject: northern natural gas
yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .
ken
dear ets colleague :
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

"Subject: hpl meter # 985579
gary :
hpl received volumes at the above meter during 1 / 1 / 99 thru 6 / 99 . prior to
1 / 1 / 99 , ena was purchasing some of the volumes from i p petroleum under
contract # 016 - 44386 - 102 ; deal # 341832 . this deal expired 12 / 31 / 99 , but the
volumes continued to flow and be allocated to i p petroleum by pioneer .
since there was no deal to cover these volumes , these volumes were allocated
to hpl strangers gas contract .
volume mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from
someone , but never received one .
here are the months and volumes that need resolution :
prod . mth mmbtus
jan . 99 6 , 510
feb . 99 6 , 395
mar . 99 14 , 789
apr . 99 16 , 866
may . 99 8 , 415
jun . 99 13 , 858
total 66 , 833
possible solution :
1 . need a deal to cover the periods in question , or
2 . provide authorization to writeoff the volumes . ( print & return original
to clem cernosek )
approval to writeoff the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
ps : my understanding is that neither i p petroleum nor pioneer have
addressed any issues concerning these volumes ."

subject : glo / egm gas / crude swap
george - i ' ve done some t - accounts ( the bean counter in me ) and i think the following is the best way to handle this going forward :
change the existing deals , 547201 and 591307 , to a zero price . this will eliminate the a / r balance on hpl ' s books for glo , but will keep the volume nom ' d to glo and will not impact ua 4 .
enter a ticket on hpl for a sale to ena for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets . this should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $ 974 , 144 for 1 / 01 and $ 766 , 304 for 2 / 01 .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book purchases the demand from hpl . the amounts would be the same as in # 2 above .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book sells demand to egm for the value of the crude oil for the prior month . for 1 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 886 , 638 . 60 ( the 12 / 00 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) . for 2 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 839 , 008 . 29 ( the 1 / 01 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) .
this will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward :
the price on the sale from hpl to glo will need to be zeroed out monthly .
the demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out .
the demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to egm .
once this is done , the a / r balance for glo will be cleared , the margin will be on the ena wellhead book , and the intercompany transactions will move the money from egm to hpl . this needs to be done monthly prior to flash , which will prevent any oa variances . the index for the gas value is available shortly after the lst of the month , and since the volume is firm , there shouldn ' t be a problem calculating the value . we should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ena to egm . if you have any questions or see a better way to do this , please let me know . thanks ."

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the " wkd " is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments ."

this is a statement that was read over the pa system at the football game
at roane county high school , kingston , tennessee by school principal jody
mcloud , on september 1 , 2000 . i thought it was worth sharing with the
world , and hope you will forward it to all your friends . it clearly shows
just how far this country has gone in the wrong direction .
" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games
to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country .
due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer
is a violation of federal case law .
as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if
someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and
calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no
problem .
i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in
activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth ,
and call it ecology .
i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict
people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and
ignorant and call it enlightenment .
however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless
this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is
violated .
this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical .
apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and
his commandments .
nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise
would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from
that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an
intentional transgression .
for this reason , i shall , " render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , " and
refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor ,
praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event ,
please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law -
yet . "
and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands
with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed
in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed
in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme
court of the united states of america - the seat of " justice " in the one
nation under god .
somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we
are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion .
praise god that his remnant remains !
let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001
jesus said , " if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my
father . "
- - - - - - - - -
if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it .
yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me
functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without
him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that
strengthens me . phil 4 : 13

here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?

"Subject: re : cornhusker
tenaska iv has been operating without a " gas agency agreement " since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

george ,
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and

"Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance
this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma -
beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) .
we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have
low gas takes . that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february .
mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month .
some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the
schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load
will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere
around 50 , 000 / d . last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 , 000 / d
through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is
this still the plan ? ?
we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to
do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would
deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter . but that meeting
was a long time ago , and we might need to meet again - you know how
conservative
one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our
midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 , 000 / d gas in kind to mobil
beaumont . so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our
maintenance .
once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle
gas flows while we do our work , i ' d like to be the one that initially tells
mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting . it ' s going to take a lot
of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule
will change !

me a voicemail . i will be out of the office friday , but checking voicemail

for williams and apache . on williams deal 384237 , the demand charge needs to
be removed from sept . 2000 . the demand charge should not have started until
october 2000 . because we did not know at the time what was happening with
this deal , the demand fee was inadvertently paid to williams for sept . and we
need to recoup our money . on apache deal 384247 , james thinks we need to
remove the demand charge completely . he says it is not a part of the deal
and apache is not billing us for it . we also need to talk about the pricing
on both of these deals . williams and apache are billing us less than what we
have in sitara . to be able to keep this desk at zero , jim pond does not want
me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases , so we need to address the
price differences . you said you had some contract briefs that supported our
prices . please fax a copy to me at 713 - 646 - 8420 and i will compare them to
what james has .
just a heads up . . . we are beginning to work on november 2000 , so we will need
a demand fee entered ( hopefully next week ) . i will email you the spreadsheet

subject : bridgeline workorder
i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning ,
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you
updated on the progress .
if you have any questions , please let me know .

please see the following instructions for the new messenging board . if you

here is the steps they should do :
1 ) launch internet explorer
2 ) type : http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com ( or just open this email and
click on above url )
3 ) users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today . if
they don ' t see any messages , there are two reasons :
( 1 ) they are not valid users . their names have not been added into the nt
web _ gastraders group yet . please contact chrysti hardy to add their names
into the group .
( 2 ) there is no new messages added yet .
4 ) click on " comments " button to add messages : there will be a popup window

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the

money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached

this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .

think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .

rebecca :
i spoke with brian nichols about the august preliminary invoice . there
appears to be a problem for august 28 & 29 - the volumes are much too low .
either there were deliveries off of centana that we are missing , or there is
a problem with the hpl data . i am having brain fade and cannot remember the
name of the person in the measurement department to contact , so maybe you
could look into this and have it corrected .
thanks

"Subject: enrononline - stack manager changes
we have made the following modifications to the enrononline applications .
stack manager changes
fill order enhancements - ( effective tuesday september 25 )
? to fill a top of stack order in stack manager , right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of stack manager and select fill .
? the trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader ' s stack on both sides .
? the order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader ' s stack volume .
? filling an order will not move the trader ' s price or cause a hedge to occur .
resize floated stack windows - ( effective tuesday september 25 )
you will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent .
website changes ( effective monday september 24 )
limit order restrictions on physical transactions -
? customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions . if a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it .
? if a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price , both orders will be cancelled . the customer would have effectively transacted with himself .
please call me if you have any questions . thanks .

subject : re : meter 0980438 - acock production ? ? ? ? ? ?
fred :
i have run this issue by clem cernosek for further research , and expect to
have his answer this afternoon . in the meantime , it is my understanding that
this well is behind the big cowboy system . at this time , we have deal ticket
380710 , purchase from ccgm , l . p . on hplc / hplc . this deal should probably be
on gulf energy / bigcowboy . the producer , as i understand it , is acock
production , however , i may be mis - informed . any insight which any of you can
shed on this deal would be very welcome , i would like to capture this
accurately and definitively as early on as possible , so as to prevent any
future issues .
thank you all for your patience and assistance ,
mary"

weekend with your precious family . we ' ll give you a call this evening or
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting ( and so sally can sing to
you ) .
we are so looking forward to seeing you , tonya , cole and jake next weekend .
we ' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
come a few days early . we will certainly enjoy our visit with them .
thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you
are . it gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved
by you . you are a wonderful father too and it ' s so apparent the bond of

because i ' m a man , when i lock my keys in the car i will
fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your
suggestions that we call a road service until long after
hypothermia has set in .
because i ' m a man , when the car isn ' t running very well ,
i will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if i know what
i ' m looking at . if another man shows up , one of us will say
to the other , " i used to be able to fix these things , but now
with all these computers and everything , i wouldn ' t know
where to start . "
because i ' m a man , when i catch a cold i need someone to
bring me soup and take care of me while i lie in bed and moan .
you never get as sick as i do , so for you this isn ' t an issue .
because i ' m a man , i can be relied upon to purchase basic
groceries at the store , like milk or bread . i cannot be expected
to find exotic items like " cumin " or " tofu " or " cardamom . "
for all i know these are all the same thing .
because i ' m a man , when one of our appliances stops working
i will insist on taking it apart , despite evidence that this will just
cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and
has to put it back together .
because i ' m a man , i must hold the television remote control
in my hand while i watch tv . if the thing has been misplaced ,
i may miss a whole show looking for it ( though one time i was
able to survive by holding a calculator ) .
because i ' m a man , i don ' t think we ' re all that lost , and no , i
don ' t think we should stop and ask someone . why would
you listen to a complete stranger - - i mean , how could he
know where we ' re going ?
because i ' m a man , i do not want to visit your mother ,
or have your mother come visit us , or talk to her when she
calls , or think about her any more than i have to .
whatever you got her for mother ' s day is okay , i don ' t
need to see it . and don ' t forget to pick up something for
my mom , too !
because i ' m a man , you don ' t have to ask me if i liked the
movie . chances are , if you ' re crying at the end of it , i didn ' t .
because i ' m a man , yes , i have to turn up the radio when
bruce springsteen or the doors comes on , and then ,
yes , i have to tell you every single time about how bruce
had his picture on the cover of time and newsweek the
same day , or how jim morrison is buried in paris and
everyone visits his grave . please do not behave as if you
do not find this fascinating .
because i ' m a man , i think what you ' re wearing is fine .
i thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine ,
too . either pair of shoes is fine . with the belt or without it
looks fine . your hair is fine . you look fine .
can we just go now ?
because i ' m a man , and this is , after all , the 2000 ' s , i will
share equally in the housework . you just do the laundry ,
the cooking , the gardening , the cleaning , and the dishes . i ' ll
do the rest ."

it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -
04 / 02 / 00 , were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase .
therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue .

this is a follow up to the conversation you had with pat yesterday and to
reiterate retro contract assignments . we have decided to go back to the old
process of handling contract assignments mid - month . this means that if we
receive an assignment from legal after the 10 th workday , that assignment will
become effective for current month the following month . for example , if i
receive a notice from whomever that xyz has been assigned to abc on 11 / 15 / 00
for an legal effective date of 4 / 00 , i will create a new deal from 4 / 00
forward . on the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the
expected volumes . bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12 / 00 ,
leaving 4 / 00 - 11 / 00 to be moved by volume mangement .
if this is not a clear understanding from all parties , please let me know .

will readdress this issue .

"Subject: fw : the odds are against them
there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved . . .
subject : the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us .
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york , washington and
pennsylvania . the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks .
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over
5 , 000 people , that means
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a
90 % on a test is an ' a ' .
* the pentagon -
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon .
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives . that is an amazing
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to
have come in too low ,
too early to affect a large portion of the building .
on top of that , the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks . it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving
untold lives . this attack
was sad , but a statistical failure .
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard .
luckily 78 % of the seats
were empty .
* american airlines flight 11
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard , but only carried
92 .
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled .
* united airlines flight 175
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty .
* united airlines flight 93
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet . the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark , saving
untold numbers of lives in the process .
* * * in summary * * *
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney
transplants and liver transplants
- all common , survivable illnesses .
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon
was hit at it ' s
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped , and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives .
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media . don ' t fear these
terrorists . the odds are against them .

"Subject: fyi - new product on eol
just so everyone is on the same page :
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new " tokenized
period " will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends .
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month
increments .
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually .
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this
nature will have to be entered manually .
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know .
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal
accordingly .
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april :
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara
ticket
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07
04 / 10 04 / 14
04 / 17 04 / 21
04 / 24 04 / 28
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade .
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date
is on the path ; otherwise
the number of reconciling items will increase .
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted .
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

per discussions that hopefully most of you have or will have with your
respective managers , you have been selected to be a part of a team to address
various issues associated with reconciling and clearing 1999 ua 4 . the scope
of the team will be to work as a team , on production months where the ua 4
number per our accounting systems is considerably larger in comparison to
what the pipeline balancing reports has as unaccounted for . this team will
be dedicated fully to this effort and will need to be prepared to contribute
whatever hours are needed to get the desired results . yvette will be
locating a room that we can occupy for all of this week and next week . this
room will be a " war room " . everyone is expected to report to the " war room "
on a daily basis and should expect to be there unless something extremely
pressing causes you to have to leave or people need to go back to their
offices to retrieve data or information . the expectations are that this
group will work to identify any volume discrepancies , adjustments , etc . and
be able to either correct or quantify those volumetric adjustments by no
later than mar . 24 , 2000 . this team is effective as of tomorrow , mar . 16 ,
2000 at 9 : 00 a . m .
yvette - please try to locate a room by then and notify the above team members
of the location . in the case that you are not able to find a room right
away , please have everyone go to brenda ' s office in eb 3748 at 9 : 00 a . m .
the items on the radar screen to address in resolving volume issues are :
1 . king ranch
2 . gulf plains plant
3 . gulf energy imbalance

"Subject: jill ,
i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .
hungerford north - where is this ?
bear den - where is this ?
moore ' s station - where is this ?
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being " good friday " and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .

"Subject: new stack manager
there is a new version of stack manager which is being released this evening ,
for use on monday morning .
changes
1 ) " inactivate suspended children " - new menu item available by
right - clicking on a parent product . it will change all child products of the
highlighted parent from " suspended " to " inactive " . note that this will be
applied only to the product which you highlight . it will also show available
when highlighting products which are not parents , but it will have no effect .
2 ) the transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those
transactions completed on the calendar day ( problem has affected australia
and singapore ) .
3 ) a constant spread which is changed from the front page of the stack
manager will stay as changed for that product . the spread will persist even
if transactions occur .
background
suspended child products continue to have their prices updated as the price
of the parent changes . inactive child products do not have their prices
updated . the price update process slows down enrononline processing and stack
manager response , so it is advantageous to ensure all non - active products are
in an inactive state .
if you have any questions on the above , please contact the enrononline call
center at :
north america : 713 853 4357 ( help )

"Subject: re : cornhusker
tenaska iv has been operating without a " gas agency agreement " since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance
howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,
michael"

rita , please help me with this . i have some questions regarding enerfin .
why are we re - allocating prior month volumes at enerfin after we matched your
original numbers back in october ? can ' t this be fixed in the actualization
process ?
the numbers for october between ena - tetco and hpl vary a good bit . are we
your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ena had
no transactions with hpl ? can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend
our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize
these small volumes to handle this ? we go round and round at this point
changing volumes two , three or more times . call me if you have questions . .

subject : re : hpl discrepancy
victor ,
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is # 421415 .
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and
october 19 th , were 9 dths and 44 dths , respectively . those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .
also , we just found out on tuesday , that the oba did not go into effect until
december 1 , 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact , i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba , do you
remember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even
informed us of this change , i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this ,
i received another email , which i will copy below , asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers , and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october , and some of hpl ' s numbers were very different from tetco ' s ,
including the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco ' s numbers and i haven ' t received a response . i will
copy that email below as well , just to catch you up on what ' s been going on .

subject : october volumes
hi jackie ,
i ran a report from tetco ' s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october , and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show . i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter , but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us . i don ' t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager , but i ' d like to make sure that on the above days , i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
which i thought was kind of strange . i am going to have to get tetco ' s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow , but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .

force majure situations during december and should not trigger the buyback
feature of the contract .
gary , i have not seen any documentation of this from valero . please follow up
with your counterpart to secure the letter of notice or we will need to
process the deal as if the buyback is active .
thanks

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .
thanks ,
kris"

she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &

accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any

"Subject: alternative work schedule status
as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was
scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be
provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future .
i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we
know are needed in our work hours .
here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting :
schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss
at the next meeting .
each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting
bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow
up with hr on schedules being used at enron
the following is what i heard at the first meeting :
our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that
would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have
the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels .
cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a " just do it "
attitude .
there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk
changes .
late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders
willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address
this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job .
there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some
type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule .
feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m
looking forward to our next meeting - bob"

back in october we had the gas received by hpl at the above meter moved to
strangers gas pending a call from coastal to renegotiate a contract for sept
2000 gas . since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger  , s gas it has
been placed on an mjg deal which was the only valid deal available for sept
2000 .
i assume coastal has not contacted brian as of yet . is it possible to have a
deal created for coastal with a price of zero ? i know that we definitely do
not want to pay mjg for this gas , but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out . let me know what you think .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

bob ,
questions based on the information in the facilitation by location report :
1 . meter 9643 hgpl / hpl - stratton , tejones operating corporation , sitara 266970 : should this purchase be at meter 9638 , freeman prod - maxine field in trade zone 18 ?
2 . i presume we are not counting both meter 9848 north padre island blk 8 and meter 9862 lehman / spinnaker onshore . isn ' t this the same gas ?
3 . meter 3536 seahawk / a - s ( mat plt 520 ) , eog resources , sitara 725391 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?
4 . meter 6884 pgtt junction 16 " lease , comstock oil & gas , inc . and kerr - mcgee oil & gas onshore l . p . , sitara 125899 and 132975 : comstock ' s volume should exceed kerr - mcgee ' s volume , and together the two volumes should be approximately 73 , 000 / d . currently , comstock ' s volume is only 8 , 600 / d and kerr - mcgee ' s volume is 25 , 000 / d . we look about 38 , 000 / d short .
5 . meter 639 hannah nash , coral energy resources , l . p . , sitara 659998 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?
i ' m looking at about 10 other old deals that i think should be in for may , but aren ' t . in addition , i ' m adding in the new deals that will flow in may . i ' ll be done by noon .

"Subject: change of control provisions
as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million .
many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision .
i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry .

subject : pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

"Subject: re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal ( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a " 10 day notification " to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to " terminate " this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

the new sitara to unify bridge monitor is in production .
the monitor shows deals in error state ( failed ) or in queue to bridge

you will find it under - start - programs - trading - sitara - su bridge
monitor .
you may need to load the borland bde v 5 . 0 software to use this , if not
already loaded .
we enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool .
if deal is in an error state on the sitara side - we have not sent it over to
unify .
if the deal in an error state on the unify side - sitara has sent it to unify
- however - it is in the unify failed deal group .
you can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit .
the date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal .
start date and stop date - are begin and end date of deal .
sitara deal id - as well as - eol deal id .
indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal .
if you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the status = p
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
( awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal ) . if you
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
access to multiple desks .
you can hit the refresh button to re - query the data - or set the auto refresh
on the tool bar .
we did not build filter by business unit for multiple reasons :
- the expense to build the filter .
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing .
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it .
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error
state - once petro can / suncor / sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column .
- if you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel
feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel .

it is my understanding the outages valero incurred at the above locations are
force majure situations during december and should not trigger the buyback
feature of the contract .
gary , i have not seen any documentation of this from valero . please follow up

"Subject: enron announcement
car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .

"Subject: new storage flag
we are going to add a new drop down flag to storage in sitara to
differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each
are
treated differently for inventory accounting purposes . a change will also
be made to global contracts and unify , and is intended to assist with oa
variances
on storage .
on the next release ( mid august ) we will add a drop down on the storage deal
type which will be a required field .
someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be
a required field - physical facility or synthetic .
( we can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be
converted - as well as results for global conversion )
global contracts uses the flags from sitara to set up new contracts - so
sitara will add the flag on the deal .
the flag will be stored in global contracts - which will feed the flag to
unify .
once the existing deals are converted in sitara , global contracts can add the
appropriate flag to their system .
once this is complete and unify is ready , unify can begin to feed in the
information from global contracts , and we will then
be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system .
in the interim time , you may want to identify your synthetic vs . physical
storage deals .
let me know if you have any questions ."

i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any

gary , mainline valves to be closed on the 18 " 3026 line are as follows :
u - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line .
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas :
air products meter 1418
albemarle meter 1188
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4 / 13 / 00 and be back
in service on 4 / 16 / 00 .

subject : deer park railroad crossing 18 " 3026 line
the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
i have been advised by the deer park rr representative , dean truitt , that
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3 / 15 / 00 .
per our conversations today , please have someone on tuesday 3 / 13 adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of " excess " gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco . please
review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey , the central desk
scheduler responsible for the cilco account . the biggest variance is in
january 2000 . cilco withdrew 200 , 000 mmbtu ' s more than we booked @ bammel .
please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for
the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel .

subject : re : meter 0980438 - acock production ? ? ? ? ? ?
i have spoken with clem , this meter is now " non - allocatable " , not unlike
meter 8751 on big cowboy . this meter needs to be set up as a receipt meter
attached to the gulf energy 27 - 009 - 08 agreement . this gas began flowing on
7 / 7 / 00 , so deal ticket 380710 , which begins 9 / 1 / 00 will need to be backed up
to july to account for the purchase of this production .
bob : please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that i can have
fred set up accounting arrangements on gulf energy .
fred : can you please determine whether or not we have paid ccgm for this gas ?
once again , thank you all for your assistance .

"Subject: king ranch
i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig
ranch contracts with exxon , and put coastal into the loop . yesterday i
forwarded each of you an e - mail from steve van hooser which had drafts of
contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is
negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we
will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a
gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant .
hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be
future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned
from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will
be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different
counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts
and different counterparties .
daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss
the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion
also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper
scheduling . as i mentioned to greg sharp and brian , it is critical that we
be kept in the loop , especially on retroactive deals , as scheduling ,
transport rates and risk are affected .

it looks like we will be making our bammel true - up payment to aep in the next couple of days . included in the payment to aep is a deduction for the sale of the centana storage gas . we are selling them 1 , 236 , 286 mmbtu @ $ 2 . 375 for a total of $ 2 , 936 , 179 . 25 . the sale is for september , 2001 production . we will need a deal put in sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics . however , there is only 1 , 195 , 754 mmbtu on report 006 in unify ( for contracts 96018371 , 96014189 , and 96019236 ) . how do we account for this volumetic difference ? connie will be truing up the gl to match the current unify volume . the gl was short approx . 18 , 000 mmbtu because a beginning balance was not booked .
this needs to happen before the upcoming close .

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a " synergi " contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a " natural fit " with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s " geographic footprint " in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . " we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , " said tutcher . " the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

i joined brian redmond on his visit a few weeks ago to sid richardson . during that visit sr indicated that they have firm lone star transport that they want to sell ( only details i know at this time is that it is 45 mm / d point to point on a true firm basis ) . i believe we could use this transport to back stop the falcon transaction ( parking gas in their facility oct / nov 01 - jan 04 ) . i spoke with the folks at sr today and indicated that we want to know more details about the sale to see if we could garner interest internally . they gave me the name of a person in their shop who would be right person to talk to about the details . i understand you would be the right person to a ) . bounce this idea off of and b ) . if there is an interest on this transport i presume you would be the best person to get the details on this transport from sr .

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .
let me know is you can ' t .

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

additional info i see in path manager . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
seems like this is a brokered deal , ect is buying 20 , 000 mmbtu from philips
gas and 14 , 000 mmbtu from superior gas and sell the total 34 , 000 mmbtu to
panenergy .
my question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas , ect or
panenergy ? we need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter 984045 .
please let me know

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &
brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to
split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,
etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jab"

subject : re : hpl transport contracts
on oasis and pgev , we have been buying and selling as hpl . however , we have been transporting the gas under ena . this is primarily for spot and base deals . we want to keep these transport contracts with ena . the only term deal we have at waha is to tufco ( 0 - 60 , 000 / day ) . this deal is under ena with it ' s own firm transport contract ( now on guadalupe pipeline , which was previously teco / pgev ) . the sale and transport will go with hpl . the sale to entex off of oasis ( currently under the ena , will be assigned to hpl ) must be served off of oasis . so hpl will need to acquire an oasis contract for this deal . let me know if you have any more questions .

subject : re : hpl transport contracts
i would think that the first contract should go the aep . ena won ' t be selling to equistar
off of channel for at least three months . ena will have to get a transport agreement with
hpl or channel .
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going
to aep . i know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis . is that for convenience ,
can hpl sever the point some other way ?
someone let me hear what you think .

i spoke with daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of :
1 . channel - 012 - 15600 - 02 - 069 ena using hpl ' s capacity - selling to equistar on channel
2 . oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena ' s capacity
3 . tejas ship and tejas gas - daren says we don ' t do business often on these pipes as ena , but we always have the possibility that we will at any time , so ena would need it ' s own transport contracts
let me know if anyone has questions . thanks !"

i need the following . . . . . . . .
assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to it connection issues or problems with the building itself ( ac , power , etc . ) . if we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30 th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side . obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely . one approach is to take the edi pipes and have them go to the 30 th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home . using this approach , and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30 th floor . i ' m open to suggestions so if you have a different approach or some good ideas feel free to share them . i need this by friday 7 / 27 no later than noon .

the issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system , per
cheryl jones , effective 2 / 00 . therefore , any purchases at that point , for
02 / 00 forward , are ua 4 and are probably having a negative impact on your
accrual . i think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level ?
there have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination , so , i

"Subject: organizational changes
we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes
are intended to accomplish four key objectives :
first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful
business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .
this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built
around a relatively small strategic asset position .
second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting
relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to
directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units
has become increasingly difficult .
third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding
asset positions .
and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .
enron wholesale services
today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate
our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale
businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and
coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to
higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of
opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of
enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and
markets .
enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european
( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets
operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit
as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant
businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this
new structure as described below .
mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume
the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,
currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office
of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .
providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership
positions :
rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president
and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility
for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north
america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo
will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will
report to the ews office of the chairman .
sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the
middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our
broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region
will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of
the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for
enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business
into enron global assets in the near future .
diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined
ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will
focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to
the ebs office of the chairman .
jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees
to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order
to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to
facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for
at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south
america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to
the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the
transition , jim will join ees .
in addition to these changes in our international asset operations
activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale
businesses and the commercial support functions :
enron net works
louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and
ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .
enron americas
concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for
operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,
marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report
into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility
for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south
america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief
operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron
americas .
enron europe
the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia
and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john
sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .
enron global markets
enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and
ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have
responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the
exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and
associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to
enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the
commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,
equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .
enron industrial markets
enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,
president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .
commercial support for ews
the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,
the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in
the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .
to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across
ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these
newly defined roles are as follows :
mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office
operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,
with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice
president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated
services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these
services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible
for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .
legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .
regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a
regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in
the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all
european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue
to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions
and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief
of staff .
public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional
basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,
enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue
in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler
will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as
well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .
these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship
to mark palmer , vice president of communications .
business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover
ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .
attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale
services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .
enron global exploration and production
and enron wind
as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments
around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to
egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff
baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron
wind , will report to cliff .
corporate staff
we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,
government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in
that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and
community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and
chief of staff .
committee structure
in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s
growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our
business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to
be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and
the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be
drawing on this group to lead company - wide initiatives such as the
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses .
the executive committee membership is shown on the attached list .
we are also forming a new committee  ) the enron corporate policy committee .
this group will be responsible for overall corporate policy , personnel
management policy and corporate strategy . the enron corporate policy
committee membership is also shown on the attached list .
we are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to
our highest return opportunities . please join us in congratulating and
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles ."

"Subject: re : big cowboy for august
mary :
is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance
between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled
for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where
985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume ,
and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have
support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350
mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of " nothing " being
confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000
this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was
scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells .
from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at
these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the
volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas
measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is
calculating the volumes incorrectly .
this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the
system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive
monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas
schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working
on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss .
tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting
arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and
possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were
originally set up in pops .
i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it
or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you .
thanks ,

subject : big cowboy for august
daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
our economics .
thank you ,
mary"

subject : re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . "
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
" warning - not the same legal entity "
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

"Subject: california energy crisis
california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state ."

for immediate release
june 26 , 2001
espn to launch sidelines network ' s second reality - based series to
premiere with texas a & m football
espn will launch a 13 - episode , prime - time series this fall entitled
sidelines , the network ' s second reality - based title under the espn
original
entertainment ( eoe ) banner . sidelines will document the season of a
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible ,
less
celebrated people who are involved with the team . the football aggies
of
texas a & m will be the focus of the series ' premiere episodes to begin
october 5 .
" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting
venture
with espn , " texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . " we couldn ' t
be
more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the
opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all
of
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . "
in a " docu - drama " style , the various stories that surround the team will
be
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives
are
directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school .
players
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral
fashion , but will not be the primary focus .
" this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted
espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people
behind
the scenes , " head coach r . c . slocum said . " we look forward to working
with
them . "
the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who
reflect
every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be
students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some
of
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university .
" each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal
story , "
said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original
entertainment . " sidelines will see each person grow in character as the
season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary . ' we ' ll weave the smaller
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression
and
fate of the team and its season . "
sidelines : texas a & m storylines
- - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) .
- - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire
collapse
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year
tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the
emotional
toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an
important
part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a
different form than has been tradition .
- - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in
overtime
to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas ,
oklahoma ,
kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for
great
drama .
- - the school invented the phrase " 12 th man " and actually owns the
trademark .
one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and
stand
ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for
every
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team .
- - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at
the
university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s
a & m
team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling
summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys .
- - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a "
30 , 000
fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition .
eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a
wide - variety
of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and
sports
news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries
or
reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by
appealing
to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is
exploring
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all
platforms of the espn family - television , internet , radio

enron capital meter no . : 6884
julie ,
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts
were assigned to ect . in october of 1998 , these contracts should have been
assigned to hplc , but did not get assigned . beginning in jan . ' 99 , negative
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
# 18372 ( meter # 6884 ) , causing my payments to be reduced . i believe that the
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract . ( the
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara
# 11079 ) . both these sales and purchases ( since october ' 98 ) are suppose to
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe
terminate in october ' 99 . the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows :
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451
per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments ?
when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?
thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need additional
information .

subject : filling vacancies and adding head count
after my recent budgeting experience , i think we need to tighten up our procedures around filling vacancies and adding head count .
when filling vacancies , i would like to have each of you review the positions . i think we need to challenge ourselves and the managers
to be as conservative as possible . i would like to sign off on all replacements . i promise not to be difficult .
when adding personnel over your current budgeted number , besides having the commercial team sign - off on the addition , i am think
that it may have to be approved by the coo of americas ( louise ) . i am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail
how to keep her in the loop in new hires resulting from business changes ( asset management deals or service arrangements )
let me know what you think .
thanks

i am working on clearing an old txu lone star / gas distribution balance from
8 / 99 and 9 / 99 . we originally billed txu on nominated quantities and they
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments . these are brokered deals where
we sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland . txu has provided
meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline , however , i am
unsure how to have volume management reallocate .
for example , we originally sold 10 , 000 mmbtu on 8 / 3 / 99 to txu and purchased
1 , 200 mmbtu from highland energy and 8 , 800 mmbtu from exxonmobil . txu shows
the total amount of gas on 8 / 3 / 99 was 9 , 240 mmbtu . how should the purchase
piece be allocated between exxonmobil and highland since this was a brokered
deal ?

right after she took her shot , then didn ' t eat anything fast acting & got in
the truck to go over to phillip ' s to get research info from his computer , got
low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs . so that ' s what scares me . she knew
to eat righ !

her when she leaves home .

the contract ( 96007529 ) should have expired under ena , but because of the timing of the expiration , it got " assigned " to aep / hpl ( 96060798 ) . therefore , for informational / historical purposes , i extended the term under 96060798 thru 5 / 31 / 01 .
someone from linda ' s group will have to extend the term under the original contract in order for the deal to be attached .

on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly . it will keep

base deal for 5000 / day and a term deal for 20 , 000 / day . only 15 , 000 of the

"Subject: cilco pathing - withdrawl and hplc transport pathing
hey guys ,
just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue . while i agree that
howard , robert and george needed to work on this together , i do not think
that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the
meeting , they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard ' s desk -
with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below
e - mail should not have come from howard , but should have originated out of
the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling
experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
took on that role in getting this set up correctly . he too had to sit down
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly
( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am
concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what
we all want between our groups , but i want to ensure that everyone does their
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed . let me know what you
both think . thanks !

brian ,
i have forwarded your e - mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project . tom hodges has talked with kerry puckett in
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want , that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely . since you are out today
i ' ll see if i can ' t get rick moncrief to send over a form of agreement we
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
partnership / jv . as this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
i believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
we look forward to working with you and your team on this project .
thanks

a lot has happened since we last met - but i wanted to get back to you
on our waha hubco project . i have attached an initial presentation on
the topic and have asked our engineers ( dave owen and tom hodge ) to get
in touch with brad to look at the physical interconnection options . we
are doing the same with tw and it would be good to understand more about
your system and your objectives . i would also like to understand your
thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would ( or would not )
like to work with enron on this .
i suggest a confidentiality agreement would be appropriate as a starting
point and if you like i can forward one for your review .

"Subject: koch midstream services co
i have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters
ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas ( sitara # 144052 ) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe ( sitara # 144049 ) . my
former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?

"Subject: important information about united healthcare - please read !
to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits
you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc )
concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate
their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network
due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation .
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 %
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to
you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter
proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract .
while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc ,
enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation
efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it
is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well .
many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals
within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those
with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake
hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo
options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between
september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial
hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network
benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other
charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be
pre - certified with uhc .
these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary
care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 .
if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed .
if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to
uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained
by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) .
open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to
consider your elections for 2001 .
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees
through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that
may impact you or your family ."

daren ,
sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

"Subject: new tax law update
whether you ' re investing for your kids ' education or your retirement , the
new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach . the $ 1 . 35 - trillion
tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas , from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes .
many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years .
but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions , we should start
planning soon . some of the ways you may benefit include :
lower income tax rates . the gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun . in fact , the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 .
and , you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new
10 % bottom rate retroactive to january 1 , 2001 . as tax rates fall over the
next few years , your disposable income will likely rise - offering an
opportunity to invest more toward your various goals .
education - funding incentives . parents who want to help their children attend
college may now find their financial task easier . the tax relief act will
improve education savings tools such as :
? education iras - the accounts ' contribution limit will rise from $ 500 to
$ 2 , 000 in 2002 . what ' s more , money in these accounts can now be used for
elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education
expenses .
? state sponsored 529 college savings plans - also beginning in 2002 ,
distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax
free . currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the
beneficiary ' s rate upon withdrawal . 529 s are particularly attractive due to
their generous contribution limits .
? deductions for education expenses - the act increases eligibility for
student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher
education expenses .
? the child tax credit - though not tied specifically to education expenses ,
this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college .
previously $ 500 per qualifying child under 17 , the credit increases to $ 600
in 2001 - 2004 , $ 700 in 2005 - 2008 , $ 800 in 2009 and $ 1 , 000 in 2010 and
thereafter .
higher retirement plan contribution limits . the tax act will allow people
with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras - possibly
helping them retire sooner and more comfortably . your options may include :
? traditional and roth iras - annual contribution limits for both of these
types of iras will gradually rise from $ 2 , 000 this year to $ 5 , 000 in 2008 .
after that , the limits will be indexed to inflation in $ 500 increments .
? 401 ( k ) s and 403 ( b ) s - working individuals also may be able to invest more
in their employer retirement plan . the limit on elective deferrals will
gradually rise from $ 10 , 500 this year to $ 15 , 000 in 2006 , and this doesn ' t
include the catch - up contribution provision for people 50 years and older .
and much more . there are other provisions in the new tax law that may
benefit you and your family . when we meet , we ' ll identify the ones that
apply to you and help you make the most of them .
as you can see , the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number
of areas . but because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are
set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be
flexible enough to react to year - by - year changes .
such planning is where american express financial advisors excels . i ' m
backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation , investments , estate
and retirement planning , and more to help you make the most of your
finances .
let me know if you have any questions . i look forward to seeing you .

"Subject: budget help ! !
salaries , salaries , salaries ! ! ! everyone is having problems .
unfortunately , many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your
staff ' s salary is . i have the average
salary for each of the different staffing levels . i have asked the hr
department to also give me
the low and the high . let ' s face it - your staff today and their salary most
likely are not what
they are going to be next year ! to much movement of people . so using
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels .
here ' s what you can do :
1 ) make a list of your staff just their positions .
2 ) then put down if you think i should budget high , mid , average , low , low to
average , etc .
you can guess at this based on their experience , length of time in that
position , etc .
3 ) then i will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget .
4 ) here is the average :
sr . $ 4 , 961
spec $ 3 , 964
staff $ 3 , 026
sr . clrk $ 2 , 548
clerk $ 2 , 264
asst $ 3 , 162
your list would look something like this :
assistant average
clerk very high
sr . clerk low
specialist low to average
specialist average
sr . specialist average to high
analyst ( they are all allocated at the same amount )
you can , however , use the exact amounts if you have them . it ' s up to you .
next item - training ! ! !
here ' s what you can do :
1 ) list your staff and the type of class they need
2 ) if you don ' t know the exact class you want to send them to , then list what
type
of class - for example personal enrichment ( i . e . time management ) or
technical ( derivatives or applied finance or wellhead to burnertip )
3 ) the personal enrichment classes cost aroung $ 500 - $ 700
4 ) the technical classes cost aroung $ 800 - $ 1000 .

team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .
regards ,
brian"

"Subject: cleburne issues
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .

?
three things :
? ? ? ? ? ?
here is this week ' s material . ? there ' s probably way too much stuff to use it
all , so i wouldn ' t even try . ? pick out the things and questions that you
feel are the most important and will hit your group the best . ? just remember
that this material is only one part of what needs to be happening in your
neon group . ? the getting to know and share with each other is critical - - use
one of the icebreaker activities you have ( even if it seems cheesy ) or
somehow ask questions and get the group talking with each other or about
themselves .
?
see the note above the material about the cd in your neon box .
?
finally , i haven ' t let you know about the new leaders we have working with
us , specifically with carol poe and the backors in neon silver - - leslie and
debbie bills ! ? welcome debbie and les !

keep up the great work !

aimee :
there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month . the
reason for the error is that the deal , # 97929 has expired . please determine
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it ?
to fix this i will set up an accounting arrangement but what i need from you
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to
put the deal on .
thanks in advance for your help ,

aquila split the volume between two points , that is why the deal changed .
the total volume was still correct . i just found out today , from stacie ,
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
tracking agreement . i had previously been under the impression that
whatever pipeline the customer wanted , buy or sell , was fine with us .
however , keeping the purchases on hub agmts . will save enron
$ . 0025 / transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .

albrecht # 4 well
meter 098 - 4179 , goliad co . , tx
lal ,
we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

subject : path manager rewrite / optimization project
importance : high
all :
we ' re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed . going foward , i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers / schedulers . we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely . who ever you choose , we would need about 15 % of their time for now . later on , with coordination efforts and testing , it may go up to 75 % . i don ' t see that happening for a while though .
the sooner we get someone to devote to this , the better off we will be . i expect these changes that we ' ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit .
that being said , we ' ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager .
1 ) currently , the path manager attempts to reuse path ids . i can ' t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step ? it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .
2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?
3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .
4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .
5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard ."

problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james

according to a survey taken by homegain , homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,
plumbing and electrical ( cost $ 338 - $ 381 ; return = 196 % ) .

gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you
can put the contract at meter 9643 .

stella :
the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops . i set up an accounting
arrangement on the 012 - 41500 - 02 - 015 contract with the track id 80705 . would
you put the contract in pops with the associated track id ?
the transportation contract ( 012 - 41500 - 02 - 003 ) for the liquids replacement
gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you
can put the contract at meter 9643 .
let me know when all of this is done so that i can reallocate the meter .

if you need it , i ' ve got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and
fuel from each location ( there numerous receipt points ) . it is possible that
we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion . in that case ,
we can use the same transport contract on lone star and transport on other
pipes also . any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed
on to the plant .

kathy - - - - - here is what i know about cornhusker :
our supply comes from apache & williams
our market typicially is the plant ( tenaska iv partners )
if the plant is down , brazos utility has the right to the gas if they want it
if brazos does not call for the gas , then we will sell off to whomever we can
we just get a flat fee on this gas per mmbtu , whether it goes to the plant or
not
daren farmer knows the specifics about the deal
hope this helps , call with any questions .

driving your costs from the activities to the commercial teams . please
select your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for
the month of february . please fill out the attached activity driver survey
with february numbers for your rc by end of day friday , march 3 rd . if your
group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data ,
please send the report to me , and put me on your recipient list beginning
next month . this will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every
month . if you would like us to collect this information from someone within
your team beginning next month , please let me know .
please take this opportunity to verify the following :
1 . the driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to
perform these activities for each commercial team .
2 . the activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified
( please let us know otherwise )
3 . if the activity is using an allocation ( for example " allocate 0469 " or
" 80 - 20 split " ) , that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not
changed from last month . ( please let us know if it has changed what the new
allocation is ) .
in reference to these surveys , please note :
if you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams
listed in the survey , please identify them . we will take your business
support costs ( such as feedback , training , etc . ) and allocate them evenly
among these teams .
the costs for " commercial team specific " activities that you filled time out
for in the january time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial
team ( e . g . genco support will trace 100 % of its costs to genco ) .

ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .

this is an outside measured volume that we don ' t receive volumes on until

transfers , particularly 0 volumes . the only possible solution is to tag all
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as ( i ) incomplete . i will let

jeff / gary ,
where is measurement in the process of sending pipeline operations more
complete data ? we continue to have this problem at various bidirectional
meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality . when mips sends
pipeline operations a zero prelim , this becomes the best available number and
overlays the estimate that gas control sends us . when this happens &
scheduling doesn ' t catch to override the zero , the desk ' s expense is
understated . this is causing a huge mess for texas operations . what is the
plan to move this up on measurements priority list ? we need an answer asap ! !
charlotte ,
at what other meters are we having this problem ?

subject : pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .
please give me a call if you have any questions ."

"Subject: big cowboy - additional production
tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase this gas at " hpl meters " at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant .
we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward .
please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or information to add .

"Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy
today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction .
deal terms
- - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing .
- - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas .
- - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares .
- - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year .
enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary .
management of newly formed company
chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo .
i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron .
management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined .
the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible .
as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses .
i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 .
i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse .
and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron .

"Subject: some after thoughts to our meeting
hi daren ,
i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning .
you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for
success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .
you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team .
this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this
problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem ?
there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members ?
i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing !
mike

mary ,
as in my email below to daren , we are seeing some oa variances between flash to actual on the ple contracts on pgev for 10 / 00 - 12 / 00 . i have verified with thu nguyen of what the statements from pgev show and that is also what we have booked in unify and recorded to the g / l as an imbalance . however , when looking in cpr ( under cpr pipeline exchange ) , there was not anything flashed for those months , thus our oa variance . i seem to remember that stacy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month on occassion , in those few times that we do , 1 ) it should be relatively small and 2 ) in the following days of the next month , we should have worked the imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month . in a voice mail from daren today , he seemed to think the same thing was happening or even that by the end of each month , we were balanced to zero . can you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had an imbalance and if we should have , why there would have not been anything flashed . if we should not have had an imbalance , then we ' ll need your help to figure out what went wrong in that pgev shows an imbalance on their statements . let me know what you think . . . . . . . . .

when i look back in cpr for the delivery periods of 10 / 00 - 12 / 00 on cpr pipeline exchange , i do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance , i . e . the buys and sales always equal in cpr . however , we are booking an imbalance every month on the parking and lending contract . should there be something in cpr for these volumes ? let me know because it is causing an oa variance for us . thanks !

fyi
this is a reduction in total capacity from 528 , 000 to 400 , 000 at station 809 .
hpl has typically been running about 180 , 000 to 200 , 000 mmbtu through station
809 in august . we can pull more gas off of the a - s line at swan lake to keep
our throughput around the 175 , 000 .
my original conversation with epfs was that the capacity would be limited to
around 400 , 000 mmbtu total during the maintenance . station 809 will be down
through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move
without 809 running . i will visit with epfs on monday and see if we can get
the volume bumped up ( to 400 , 000 ) and adjust on tuesday as necessary .
if you have any questions please call . 36449 .

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 " line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

we are working toward a cut - off date of january 14 , 2002 , at which time we will no longer support email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname . lastname @ enron . com ( or firstname . middleinitial . lastname @ enron . com if your name in lotus notes or outlook has a middle initial in it ) . we understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard email address format , but it is important to begin making the change now .

subject : supported internet email addresses
enron global technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non - standard internet email address formats . the only internet email address format that will be supported , once this effort is completed , is firstname . lastname @ enron . com . we will no longer support internet email address formats such as name @ enron . com , name @ ect . enron . com , name @ ei . enron . com ( where " name " is an abbreviation , acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and / or lastname ) . every enron employee has an internet email address of firstname . lastname @ enron . com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this internet address format if they are not using it already .
any new / existing application systems or business cards that reference a non - supported internet email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet address format . it is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending internet email to any non - supported internet email addresses .
to determine what your supported internet email address is , take your name as it appears in outlook or lotus notes and replace any " spaces " that appear in your name with periods and append @ enron . com . for example in outlook , alan smith , robert ( firstname = robert , lastname = alan smith ) will have a supported internet email address of robert . alan . smith @ enron . com .
important : if you need to update your business card ( s ) to reflect your supported internet email address , please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards . if you experience any issues with delivery of internet email to your supported internet email address , please contact the resolution center .
we will communicate further details , including the cut - off date , in the coming weeks . meanwhile , it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet email address format . if you have questions regarding this email , send an email to enron . messaging . administration @ enron . com .

subject : fw : crm database
as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 .
the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero .
there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free !
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : crm database
on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information .
the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities :
1 . account & contact management
2 . activity tracking & planning
3 . potential deal management
4 . outlook synchronization
5 . remote connectivity / synchronization
6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity
the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system :
industrial mkts freight mkts
users 175 45
counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000
contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000
activities 1 , 200 900
quotes 150
opportunities 361 11
the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented :
eol
global mkts
ees
transportation
east power orig
insolvent debt
some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) .
the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups .
colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side .
thanks ,

"Subject: p & l
tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for
the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about
8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this .

thanks , bob . it now turns out that due to operational issues , the additional 10 , 000 / d may not come on next week . spinnaker is having problems dealing with all the condensate associated with this gas and may not have the proper equipment in place to allow the additional gas to flow and also handle the additional condensate associated with that gas . i ' ll keep you posted .

the texas general land office transport volume is in pops for may nominated at 4 , 800 / d . deal # 535132 was initially set up as a wellhead purchase from texas general land office . the transport volume of 4 , 800 / d comprises approximately 22 % of the total volume nominated at the meter .

spinnaker exploration company , l . l . c sit 379424 5 , 886 / d 27 %

the houston exploration company sit 535119 5 , 045 / d 23 %
it appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132 , which shows 0 as the expectted volume . texas glo has historically transported about 23 % of the gas at the n . padre is . block 883 l .
once it starts flowing , the incremental 10 , 000 mmbtu / d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above .

jay ,
let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?

though she ' s dead and has just been located , after 5 years , this lady
continues to haunt us from her shallow grave .
get this :
cbs will be forced to discontinue " touched by an angel " for using the word
god in every program . madeline murray o ' hare , an atheist , successfully
managed to eliminate the use of bible reading from public schools a few
years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the
same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington ,
dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the
reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america .
they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is
successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by
television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all
christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a
christian can help !
we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their
effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned
about our country . as christians we must unite on this .
please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in
our school and in offices across the nation .
please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard .
together we
can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity
for the lost to know the lord .
please press " forward " , clean up the message , and forward this to everyone
that you think should read this .
now , please sign your name at the bottom ( you can only add your name after
you have pressed the " forward " ) .
don ' t delete any other names , just go to the next number and type your name .
please do not sign jointly , such as mr . & mrs . each person should sign
his / her own name .
please e - mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this , and help
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion .

"Subject: purchasing computer equipment
in order to ensure that all computer - related equipment is being properly
capitalized and not expensed in your rc , i would like to centralize the
purchase of equipment for energy operations . going forward , if you need to
purchase equipment for a new employee or need to upgrade your existing pc
and / or monitor , please send me an e - mail containing the following information :
employee name ( indicate if the employee is new )
location
phone extension
equipment you would like to purchase
existing system number if upgrading your pc
i have set up an rc exclusively to capture purchases of computer - related
equipment . this will make it easier to properly capitalize these assets .
one more thing i need for each of you to do . please review your rc reports
for january 2000 and make sure that there aren ' t any pc purchases charged to
your rc . you can find them in cost category 601 " non - capitalized hardware
and software " . if you had any charges in this category for equipment , please
forward a copy of your rc report to me as soon as possible so that i can work
with brian heinrich to have the charges reversed from your rc in february .
if you have any questions , please call me at ext . 3 - 6343 . thank you in
advance for your help to ensure that your rc does not go over budget for
purchases of equipment that should be properly capitalized .

just following up my voicemail to you yesterday - - - john griffith has
contacted me regarding the gas management agreement relating to the
cornhusker transaction . when dan was in my office several weeks ago , we spoke
with you and it appeared that some of the financial terms of the gas
management agreement were yet to be worked out - - has that occurred yet ? do you
know the details of the extension on the transition agreement ? are you
available to meet on this in the next day or two and is there anyone else you
think should be included ? ( john griffith has asked to be included and
suggests darren farmer and bob hall be present as well ) - - please let me know

"Subject: new enrononline functionality
several changes have been made to stack manager and the website . these changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of monday september 3 , 2001 .
stack manager changes
activate / inactivate stack - this functionality allows the trader to pull a product ' s prices from the website without suspending the product . if the top of stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product ; therefore , if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website .
if a product ' s stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager . if the stack is active it will appear in black font .
to use this feature , select the product , right click and choose " inactivate stack " . when you are ready to reactivate your prices , select the same product , right click again and choose " activate stack " . there are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will activate / inactivate the stack of the highlighted product . see screen shot below for the icons .
changes to product properties - currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen , the product will be suspended and pulled from the website . now instead of being suspended , the product ' s stack will become inactive . once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the activate stack icon as discussed above .
website change
restrictions on top of stack orders - if top of stack limit orders are allowed on a product , but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer , limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product .
if you have any questions please call me at 31787 . thanks .

"Subject: enron net works
it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business
opportunity ."

i ' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 ( as far as getting it out of my allocation

hear back from daren or julie .
should daren or julie get back w / you , while i ' m on vacation , please get back
w / anita luong and provide her with the k # given to you ( by daren or julie )
as well as the dates of 2 / 1 - 2 / 29 ( even though 3 / 1 / 2000 is reflected in my

it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is

problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

subject : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
bob , et al ,
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions .
although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto
sitara and tds , we do see some potential for this happening again towards the
end of this month and the beginning of next month .
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,
along with updates to those deals . a large portion of these updates come to
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could
continue to have the unify data " cleaned / scrubbed " week to week and try to
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month
would help .
another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to
have 2 months " active " at a time . in other words , when november is over and
we are in the first week or two of december , sitara continues to maintain
positions for november . this november data degrades the ability to update
december positions in a timely manner . we may find ourselves having to
remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in
the past .
i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days / weeks to
implement some combination of quick fixes , as well as look into the long term
changes necessary to support our increased trading business .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area .
thanks , d . n ."

just to set the record straight , measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate . we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information , and absent information to the contrary , the
recorded volumes were published . the hms technician , charlie speigel , was
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow . we will correct the
statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion .

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .
thanks

a volume of 6 , 289 mmbtu flowed over the noms for cp & l . i don ' t have a record of a spot deal with them for that day .
gary - currently , that volume has been allocated to the term agreement . the price difference on that day is significant . ( hsc gd mid was 5 . 245 ) . if you don ' t have a record of a spot deal , the allocation should stand as it is .

darren :
here is my problem . as you know , hplc did a deal with texas general land office where we would exchange gas for crude . the problem was hplc was selling the gas and enron gas marketing was receiving the crude . bryce baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between hplc , ena and egm that would book the deal correctly . julie meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed january and february , except for one small part , but march forward was never completed . the attached word document explains the procedure . basically , we were suppose to book an hplc sale to the tglo with volume and zero price . this would book the volume to the gl and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from tglo . then , we would book a sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - wellhead for the value of the gas only ( no volume ) and a sale from ena - wellhead to egm for the value of the crude ( no volume ) . for these deals , we would use demand fees . egm will pay ena for the crude dollars .
i will give you the deals for january so you can see how the dollars move . you will see that the price is still on the sale from hplc to tglo . julie zeroed this out , but o ' neal put it back . i ' ve left him a message to find out why .

2 . sale from hplc - im hplc to hplc - im wellhead 547205

txu revised their rates for jan 2001 . they are now billing us at $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 08 for contract 1671 . this was previously billed all at $ 0 . 10 . please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $ 3 , 841 , 888 . 11 to $ 3 , 830 , 131 . 18 .
also , i spoke to txu about the rate on contract 1856 ( deal 452475 ) . they have been billing us $ 0 . 11 and we have $ 0 . 10 . the extra cent is for the el paso header fee . the pricing you gave me is for contract 1671 , but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6 . you ' ll see a a section called " compression & header expense if utilized " . the current rate for 1856 is $ 0 . 01 and 0 % fuel . i will leave a copy of the contract in your chair .

thoughts on texas a & m . . .
fox sports show host jim rome
1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and
red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in
their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the
feeling the entire school was built to spite ut .
2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s
passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a
subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach
agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from
where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m
to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original
creation . like danny devito in " twins " .
3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must
devote
their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good .
all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they
won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how
they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell
them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is
the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in
everything a & m does .
4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at
a & m .
there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas '
answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never
learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now ,
forget the fact that a however ,
nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of
the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act
like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect
these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is
only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat
up civilians , move to israel .
5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national
television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the
stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be
against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to
mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime
anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and
start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked
down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have
moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were
gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game ,
some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s
thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a
suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board .
some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique
counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give
them a veil .
6 ) " t . u . " is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if
folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be
funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it .
please learn .
7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of
sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall
down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit
whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for
the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing
how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for
governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form
asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 " , weight
185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east
texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade
education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base .
this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid .
8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder ,
they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability .
the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about
marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high
school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then
and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you
do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ?
9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the
only
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an
anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now .
10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat
their own feces and should be treated accordingly .
11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that
it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that
should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any
better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending
" dukes of hazard " episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to
austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open
minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace
and final resting place of all that is cool .
as my friend stephen johnson once said : " if the world were ever to get an
enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . " if you go to
school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie .
god bless the great state of texas .

"Subject: re : ua 4 - meter 1441 for 11 / 97 - falfurrias
howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

in response to cheryl ' s note , in looking at a copy of a confirmation letter confirming the proposed agreement reached on march 1 , 2000 to be effective april 1 , 2000 through march 31 , 2001 , there is evergreen language .

subject : re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal ( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a " 10 day notification " to terminate , there isn ' t any reason to " terminate " this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change .

if you need it , i ' ve got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and
fuel from each location ( there numerous receipt points ) . it is possible that
we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion . in that case ,
we can use the same transport contract on lone star and transport on other
pipes also . any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed
on to the plant .
if you have any questions , let me know .

kathy - - - - - here is what i know about cornhusker :
our supply comes from apache & williams
our market typicially is the plant ( tenaska iv partners )
if the plant is down , brazos utility has the right to the gas if they want it
if brazos does not call for the gas , then we will sell off to whomever we can
we just get a flat fee on this gas per mmbtu , whether it goes to the plant or
not
daren farmer knows the specifics about the deal
hope this helps , call with any questions .

of as a credit in the deduction section . the various benefit deductions will
remain itemized in the deduction section .

payroll faq  , s
my paycheck has a line called  & other deductions  8 , what does that stand for ?
there is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck . for
some employees , the number of deductions are more than we have room to
print . in this circumstance , the system totals all remaining deductions and
prints them on one line  ) titled  & other deductions  8 . the detail of all
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet
at ehronline . enron . com .
what do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean ?
these definitions are listed on the payroll webpage located at
hrweb . enron . com , select enron payroll from the side index .
why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck ?
overtime is paid one pay period in arrears , therefore it will be reflected in
the next pay period . for example , if you reported overtime for the
july lst  ) 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay advice
as  + povertime  , .
what is the limit for social security ( fica ) ?
for year 2000 the limit is $ 4 , 724 . 40 on a wage base of $ 76 , 200 . this limit is
applied to each enron payroll tax company . therefore , if you transfer to
another enron company these limits will start over , however , the total amount
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub . excess fica
will be credited to you by the irs via your tax return .
what federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when i exercise stock
options ?
there is a standard federal income tax rate of 28 % for these earnings . this
can be higher if the employee has completed a supplemental tax form

we are still having problem with this meter . from what i understand of our
conversation a week or two ago , hpl needs to take the swing to keep the other
contracts whole . in the case where we have excess flow the hpl ( r ) contract
takes the swing . so in the case where we are short , shouldn ' t we have a hpl
( d ) contract to take the swing ? please let me know if this will work . i
need to get back with settlement today . thanks

i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was

sherlyn ,
the pops meters 7107 , 7108 , and 7109 need to stay non allocatable and need to be allocated on unit gas pipeline . you will need daren or michael at enron to do the following
add meters 7107 , 7108 and 7109 on unit pipeline to sitara deals 70550
70549
70119
then you can run the pops 53 report for these meters or use your allocation to properly allocate to the meters on unit pipeline .
once this is done , let me know and i will zero out the pops meters .

attached please find the hours survey and instructions for the month of may ,
2000 .
i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the " bar is being raised " by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .
while completing the survey , take this time to review last month ' s numbers .
please return these surveys to shari mao by end of day friday , june 2 .
please note the following changes :
the nat gas rc ' s will now see deal validation and transportation rate
activities therefore , these surveys will be notably longer but will not
necessarily take more time
if the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on ,
please do not type any activities in the survey . contact jennifer reside at
# 35971 to discuss how to proceed .
if you have any questions relating to the model or this survey , or are unable
to meet the survey due date , please call jennifer reside at # 35971 ( shari is

"Subject: re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to

changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms " tom ' s words of warning " -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

subject : re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to
assignment )
fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . "
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
" warning - not the same legal entity "
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

matrix rates and all baseload rates that i know of at this time . i have not
yet received third party transport rates , so if you know of any , please let
me know . also , i have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for june , so
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them . rule of thumb
was that if i had to add a month , i refreshed the rate but left volume at
zero . if the months were already on the ticket , then i refreshed the rate
and left the volume as is .
i would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure
they ' re reflected in position manager correctly . please let me know if you
have any questions . all pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning .

welcome to the expatriate zone
welcome to the " first " issue of " the expatriate zone , " the official
newsletter of the new " expatriate zone " web site . after publishing " the
temperate zone " for the past two years , i ' m taking the opportunity to join
forces with bob segel who has been publishing " the coconut modem " with karen
coyne since april of 1994 .
last year , after operating in aol exclusively , bob created " parrotkey . com "
out on the " internet " where it would join it ' s sister site on aol and be
accessible to all parrot heads . at the time bob expanded " pk , " we had been
working on my little area of " club st . somewhere , " and the new
" parrotkey . com " seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club .
while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see " club st .
somewhere " and " parrot key " go , we could see that this was the perfect chance
to , as emeril says , " kick it up a notch . "
jimmy buffett ' s music was a big part of our lives , but even more so was the
" expatriate lifestyle " he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical
travel , sailing , boating , parasailing and surfing , and yes , the music and
lyrics of mr . james w . buffett .
so it is , that we created our new web site , " the expatriate zone "
, along with this newsletter of that same
name . in december , " the expatriate zone " opened its doors with its " island
trading post " with its holiday shopping service at the " island trading post . "
over 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were
awarded for the first two weeks . the " island trading post " will open again
soon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us
that live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough
to be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we ' ll start with the
" t - shirt of the month . "
we want " the expatriate zone " to not only keep you entertained and informed
while you toil away at your everyday " corporate gig , " but it will also get
you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into " the
expatriate zone . "
we hope you all enjoy our new effort , and also continue to visit " parrot key "
and " club st . somewhere . " both of which will be closely associated with " the
expatriate zone " and " parrotkey . com . "

" expatriate of the month "
james " sunny jim " white
when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named " sunny
jim " who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance
to connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to
happen , it usually does .
on the first leg of my " road dawg " tour
( click on " road dawg " ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and
their wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex
and i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was
" sunny jim . " i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it
immediately . the cd was his second , called " life in the laid back lane . "
little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady " shady floyd "
several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real
tour of the us since he moved " down island " almost twelve years ago . we got
several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article
about this " expatriate " soon on " the expatriate zone " web site . be sure to
watch for it .
in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great
musician . when i asked him about his " expatriate " status , his reply was ,
" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country ,
for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they
want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly
twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience ,
from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving ,
hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying
palms . "
even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there
were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? " maybe
somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within
sailing distance of one another , " was the advice he gave .
until we can learn more of " sunny jim ' s " world , stop by his web site at
and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his
latest release " sandbar serenade , " for goodness sake , pick one up . you can
also read a great interview alex conducted with james at

travel into " the zone "
" some are running from the irs "
we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens
and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one
our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops ,
cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if
we feel the need . but get real and throw that " pager " away as soon as you can .
we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from
those of you already living your lives in " the zone , " helping the rest of us
prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that
are preparing to " disappear " to places like costa rica , where the " the
expatriate zone " will become an important tool .
how would you like to check out a place to " disappear " to and write it off
your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into " the zone " to places like
the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic
or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a
coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?
well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then
get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .
depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up
to half the trip .
the oceanic society
earthwatch institute
reef , the reef environmental education foundation
after that , all that ' s left is to make that plane reservation , and remember ,
" no plane on sunday . "

" jimmydotcom "
after many delays , " jimmydotcom " has finally gone to the printer with a due
date of the middle of april . i hit some " bumps in the road " on my way to
publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was
all worth it .
this book isn ' t about jimmy buffett , it ' s about the effect of the internet on
parrot heads . for more information , visit . we
have a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and
samples of the pages on the site .
financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at
the present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you
reserve your copy by putting your name on the " reservation list . " you will be
under no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial
partners ( who aren ' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do
it right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a
copy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing .
let ' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big
success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me
they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss
to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .
maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends " that
just don ' t get it . "
here ' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder &
president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with
this club on the " road dawg " tour , and shared an advance copy with his club :
" when we received jackson ' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away .
we hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs
from around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this
collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is
your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , ' cause this book is packed
with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! "

club trini update
speaking of expatriates , how about the guys who play the true music of " the
zone ? " club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this
april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert
pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third
in the " margaritaville cafe - late nite " series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as
my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was
recorded .
you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s
revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve
become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t
heard ct ' s version of " african friend " you ' re in for a real treat . along with
that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this
past summer , " cario " and bob marley ' s " no woman , no cry . "
at the new web site , fans can " now " order their favorite club trini cds using
their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available .
i think a true " expatriate musical library " is incomplete without club trini .
this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer ,
came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the " ice cream
vendor " shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok ,
pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves
somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a
t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .

jesters and friends
note card series
tro - pics has just released their first note cards
series from their " jesters and friends " original oils . friends , places and
musicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and
expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times
when an email just isn ' t personal enough .
the original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and
visit them . included in the " jesters " series are our good friends tim glancey
and wally nickel .

millennium change bubba style
i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this " new millennium " thing , one
bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve
show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at
the last minute , i had a change of heart .
and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new
margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded
together for me , making the millennium change over very special .
if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our
new " the expatriate zone " web site at and go to
the web version of this newsletter .

flash ! ! ! " expatriated phans " spotted south of the border
after making both of " tropo travel ' s " previous trips down to cobo san lucas ,
mexico , i had to miss this year ' s trek due to my being with the " beach house
on the moon " tour on it ' s florida , new orleans and houston swing .
as the story goes , those bad boys and girls from " the expatriated phan club "
showed up again , mainly for the t - shirts that
said , " too much tequila . . . or not quite enough " on the back . who are those
people anyway ? whenever i go to their web site , all of them have black bars
covering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for
" down to the banana republics - 2000 " visit mike
mclain also has some other great trips planned this year , check them out .
speaking of " tropo travel , " if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine
shows and want a great deal , visit there site for some great rates . i ' m
joining some of my parrot head friends at the " key largo , " though i ' m kind of
afraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit
phc . i ' m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i
hate seeing jimmy in vegas , but i ' ve got to keep the streak alive , and seeing
all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer
ends up playing there again this year .
and speaking of those great t - shirts , we have some neat shirts available at
the " island store . " they ' re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this
year ' s trip , except they have " tropo travel ' s " seaplane on the back and the
" no bad days " logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at
.

parrothead pilots association
here are a couple of tidbits for your " airplane nuts " and pilots out there .
a new online friend who ' s a medivac chopper pilot is trying to start a parrot
head ' s pilot ' s association . if you ' re interested , contact dan at
.
i also ran across a really cool page that features jimmy ' s " hemisphere
dancer " including it ' s " jamaican bullet hole . " ed booth , jr . an attorney from
jacksonville , florida , who belongs to " lawyer - pilots bar association " is the
webmaster and creator .
the web site is " grumman n 928 j " ( flashback - how many of you remember the tv
show ' whirly birds ' ? wasn ' t their number n 975 b ? ) and is at
it shows a lot of pictures of jimmy ' s 1954
grumman i think you ' ll enjoy .
now all we need is for these guys to team up with the parrot heads pilot ' s
association .

"Subject: new enrononline functionality
the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose " fill order " . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose " no auto inactivate when stack manager is down " .
changes regarding suspension of products
stack manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases :
? market close - if a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending . in order to keep a product ' s stack active past the set trading hours , the trader should choose " keep awake " next to the trading hours section of the product properties page .
? auto suspend now inactivates stack - on a product with the auto suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product , the product ' s stack will be inactivated if the suspend at level is reached . this feature can be used by checking the enable box on the product properties page under the auto suspend section .
? logging out of stack manager - when you log out of stack manager without inactivating or suspending your products , the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them ."

conoco has nominated 5 . 0 / d at this meter . conoco transport can be allocated
the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
exceed 5 . 0 mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter .
hpl may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why i
wanted you to be aware of the daily activity thus far .

sorry that i haven ' t followed up yet , but we are in the middle of
implementing sap ( which i ' m sure
you have heard about ) , and haven ' t had time to put the sample report
together .
what i have at
present is a report from our scada system that must be run manually each day ,
to get a report of
yesterday ' s volumes , beginning and ending at 7 : 00 a . m . the problem is , until
i
can revise it , the
report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers , and i need to
create a new one with only the
hpl stations . i also want to set it up for automatic creation , to run at
approx . 8 : 00 a . m . daily . it would
then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board , such as
is
currently being operated
by george perrine . i will be coordinating this effort with george in that
regard . until i have completed the
entire task , however , i will try to send you a daily ( 5 days per week ) report
created manually , showing the
previous day ' s volumes for our monitored hpl stations . i am shooting for
starting this tomorrow .
i have also been discussing this with royal edmondson of our gas supply
dept . , and he wants us all
to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information
between
all interested parties . he
will be getting back with you on this ."

subject : re : copano
that is not what i am conveying . there may be changes made to the set flow
periodically , but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of
the copano pipeline that may be swinging due to some other customer on their
system . whenever entex asks for a new set point at the new woodlands city
gate , our set point at the new bammel interconnect should align with that
same set point so as there is no swing service on the copano pipeline . our
instructions should only come from entex to change the set point , and should
be confirmed with copano . we are not to provide any instantaneous swing
service on the copano lake creek lateral . any swing provided by hpl for the
woodland ' s load will be made into the copano 12 " ( formerly ksc ) line as
historically done . there may be additional capacity needed on the lake creek
lateral because of the revised set point , but that is something that entex
has negotiated with copano independent of hpl . still fuzzy ?

hello ,
we have prepared january and february data and will be scheduling meetings

will collect the time your team spent on performing their activities in the
month of march .
note : we are now collecting eol related activities . if you spend time
directly supporting eol , and your survey does not have an activity that you
can assign these times to , please contact me as soon as possible so we can
add the appropriate activities to your survey .
to fill out the survey :
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labelled " select your rc " .
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message " select
position from drop box ! " you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,
specialist , etc . ) and " ok " . the choices for positions are based on
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed
that should be , please call me to discuss as it would indicate that
corrections need to be made to the database ) . once you have the list of
activities , please input hours ( for the entire month ) for each activity
listed in the column labelled " hours " .
if you ' re filling out the survey for your team , save a file for each of the
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position .
if you do not , the information will be lost .
we have included february compiled hours per position ( if you had two
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each , the " last month "
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month ) . as with last month , you
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send
this survey to each of your team members , allowing each individual to fill
out the time they spent on each activity . if there are any activities you

the above meter is currently doing 13 . 0 on a 26 . 0 nom .
please take a look and see if nom adjustments might be a solution .
looking @ deal # 109670 , the terms indicates that hplc buys 2 . 5 % of saxet
volumes . should i assume that i should take the total flow amount ( per day
for this deal ticket ) and adjust the expected volumes to reflect a nom that
is 2 % of the daily flow versus the " 1 " that is currently nomed ?

i believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee
in your example # 1 .
if we do the fee this way , we will not double up the volumes .

the most current worksheet is tab # 2 marked final

there are 2 ways that i can enter this fee into sitara :
1 ) i can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee .
2 ) i need you to give me volume ( s ) and a price to input into the deal . i
can ' t just input a dollar amount in sitara .
let me know how you want to handle it .

i researched the statements you sent me and found deal ticket # 109925 in
sitara which shows hplc transporting on midcon from live oak to hardy street
for $ . 04 / mm for the months of august and september .
the statement for november covers gas moving from katy tailgate to cogen
lyondell and is covered by sitara deal ticket # 133257 . the deal ticket shows
a zero rate , however . elsa / daren - do either of you remember this deal ? it
was on november 30 th for 5000 mm . kellie - what is midcon charging for this
haul ?
thanks ."

"Subject: re : txu imbalance
james , thanks for following up on this .
fyi to all , the agreement we have with el paso has a fairly tight confidentiality provision that goes to internal ( as well as external ) communication of the transaction :
" no party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers , employees , representatives , consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information , all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information . "
the language stems from a problem we had when east coast power was sold late last year , but probably works to our advantage in this case . suffice to say that this group needs to be plugged in on what ' s coming down the pipe . however , we need to limit discussion of the transaction to the maximum extent possible .
thanks ,

due to no volumes being scheduled in pops but volumes appearing in mops . the

subject : re : canus meter 5310
lauri ,
effective 3 / 1 / 2001 , hplc amended its contract with royal production changing
the price to 100 % hsc less $ 0 . 16 and extending the term through 2 / 28 / 02 .
consequently , for march , hplc should be purhasing volumes from two wells at
meter 5310 . effective april , hplc amended the same contract releasing the
l . g . talbert # 2 lease in the committed reserves agreement ; mike morris is the
gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000 mmbtu / d . for april i nom
1132 / d ; bob , we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental
production at this point .

subject : canus meter 5310
louis cox with copano ( the interconnecting party at this meter ) informed me
that effective march lst , we should have been buying incremental gas from
royal production at this point since they were no longer selling it to
copano . there have been no changes in the producer services noms at this
point , however . this point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow
i have access to shows noms of 1332 mm with bav of 3497 mm on march 18 th .
bob / vance - could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should
be ? copano says they ' re not getting the gas in april either , but they do not
know how long hplc is purchasing the incremental gas from royal . please let
me know what the resolution is . thanks ."

transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating devon ' s
pvr . we do not have access to their contracts to do
the noms . ces use to have transco do it for them and so did we for january
and february , but nothing was nominated for march or april . i
mentioned this to nelson and dan junek back in march , but nothing was
decided . at one time , devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their
information . could you find out if we are responsible for the pvr and if we
are , they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts ? maybe you
will have better luck than i did .

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .

in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

friday 3 / 23 - received a page from silver in gas control at 8 : 00 pm regarding the gulf plains plant . they were cut into another pipeline ( tennessee ) , and wanted to overdeliver to us by 10 m for the night . larry zammit paged 8 : 05 pm , reiterated same . we agreed to take the additional volume for the remainder of the evening only .
saturday 3 / 24 - 7 : 30 am , received page from lee in gas control regarding the gulf plains plant , apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for saturday ' s gas day as well . phoned larry zammit and spoke with him regarding the situation at the plant , he indicated that there may have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant . larry phoned the plant and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver to , or swing on , hpl .
2 : 00 pm - phoned lee in gas control to see how the pipeline was doing . he indicated that we were pretty tight , but would probably make it without utilizing any oba ' s .

listed below are some guidelines for gathering the necessary information for netco contract setup so we can get as much done as possible prior to our start date . i suggest each manager start making the phone calls and if necessary get others at the desk to help out . again , the goal is to get hard copies of the contracts in our hands for review so we can fill out all of the necessary information ahead of time . take good notes on the questions that come up when speaking with the pipes . we can get legal involved as needed when major issues surface .
please let me know if you have any further questions , tks - bob

hi all -
attached above is the master list of contracts we ' ll need for day 1 of newco . as the footnotes indicate , we ' ll also need new business party id ' s / passwords , an ebb agreement for all pipes and a tpa for each edi pipe ( tammy & i will be working on tpa ' s and ebb ' s ) . the timing indicated assumes that we have a clear newco structure , that the newco credit status has been identified , and that a duns number has been established . the two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines ' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through legal on each end , so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3 - 5 days even for pooling agreements . for the ldc ' s and intrastates , we ' ll need to specifically identify what each requires .
as we discussed , we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information :
pipeline contact name and number ( i know some of you sent me this b / f - - but pls make sure that it ' s the legal / regulatory contact , not your business counterpart )
credit requirements for a new entity with an " a " credit rating ( they may just refer you to the tariff , if so , pls . ask them for a specific site so we can do the research )
get a sense of the reaction of the pipe / ldc regarding credit for the new entity - - we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting .
in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old enron bills , just reiterate that we ' re setting up a completely new entity and give them bob ' s , mine , or jeff hodge ' s name to discuss the estate issues .
if there are different requirements for different service levels ( ie , pooling vs . it vs . ft ) , pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe .
we need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level - - pls . ask the pipe / ldc to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it . once we have those together , i ' ll run the traps with legal .
it would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier , then work on the second .
i will be out of the office thursday & friday , but please call me on my cell phone at 713 - 516 - 2574 with any questions .
thanks ,
suzanne"

on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in 1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas , they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have been connected with the lord ? s work in croatia for all these years . before leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday . dragica and i believe god listens and hears prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,
malden and dragica jovanovic"

i just have to brag on myself as my game seldom affords me the opportunity .
sunday after church , tom knox and i played 18 holes at mimosa . the weather
was perfect . while my game stunk overall ( 118 ) , i did manage par on one par
3 and two par 5 ' s . the best was at 14 - - - a 545 yard par 5 . my drive was
280 yards ( the ground was flat ! ) . i was on the green three feet from the
pin in 3 , and then two - putted . those three pars however will keep me going
back . remember , i had a witness !
thanks for listening to me brag . and no , don ' t expect me to replicate these

and bring it safely back to your side . of course , it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky , because if you get caught on your opponent ' s side , then
you have to wait until you are freed . it is a very fun game , but even more

george ,
at the 9 th workday meeting you had asked if we had seen the paper on the
above referenced . i have checked our database , and it appears that we have
not . the contract in the system does reflect at gs at this point .
i also checked on teco gas processing company , and it does not appear we have
seen the paper on this one either .
thank you ,

could you please remove scada / mips from the following hpl meters . these
meters are where mid - texas interconnects with
pg & e ' s system , and there should not be any measurement taking place on hpl .
these meters were set up originally when we thought
that every meter on mid - texas should automatically have a corresponding meter
on hpl . this assumption is now incorecct .

"Subject: netco items
wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a " final or startup " list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements ."

just wanted to keep everyone on point in terms of the importance and
expectations of getting this king ranch issue cleaned up for the prior months
and correct on a go forward basis . i spoke with brenda on friday to give her
an update of our progress and one of the things that she stressed and wanted
passed on to the team was the expectations that king ranch would be clean
( scheduled and allocated correctly ) for march and foward . as of thursday
night ' s p & l calc . , unaccounted for march 2000 on texas was a little over
400 , 000 mmbtus . as you all know , that number is way too high and should be a
lot lower ( on a bad month , no more than 100 , 000 mmbuts ) . hopefully , if king
ranch is the part of the problem for march and we get these issues resolved ,
march will not be an issue . i appreciate everyone ' s committment so far and
hopefully we can apply this team concept in the future to prevent crisis
modes like this from here on out . if anyone has questions or concerns ,
please do not hesitate to let me know . thanks !

monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

albrecht # 4 well

shawna ,
attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

albrecht # 4 well
meter 098 - 4179 , goliad co . , tx
lal ,
we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?
